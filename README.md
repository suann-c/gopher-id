# gopher-id
Have you ever struggled with gophers ruining your beautiful yard while you're away? Or even worse, eating all the crops 
you've worked so hard to grow, behind your back? With gopherID, you won't even have to be present to check up on your yard.
gopherID will automatically notify you if a gopher has been detected in your yard.
The aim of this project is to create a visual gopher detection system using computer vision techniques.
